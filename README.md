# README

This web application made by JR and Dan-Vy is called jr&vy: recipe keepers. This site is designed to crowdsource recipes from users and to search the web for recipes from other users.

Users can like recipes to let other users know they like their contributions, and favorite recipes for when they'd like to try to make them later.

On their user profile, users can see how many likes and favorites their recipes have gotten, change their password, or create a shopping list for all their favorited recipes.

Users can search for recipes or find inspiration looking for recipes that are the most favorited on the site.
